This installs:

    dnsmasq – Lightweight DHCP + TFTP
	{
		DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
		➤ What it does:
			Assigns IP addresses automatically to clients on the network.
			Provides boot information for PXE clients, such as:
				The TFTP server IP
				The boot file name (like pxelinux.0 or bootx64.efi)

		TFTP: Trivial File Transfer Protocol
		➤ What it does:
			A very simple file transfer protocol (unlike FTP or HTTP).
			Used to transfer boot files (like kernels, initrd, PXE bootloader) from the server to the client.
			Operates over UDP (port 69).
		➤ Why it matters in PXE:
		After the client gets the boot file name from DHCP, it contacts the TFTP server to download that file and begin booting.


		| Component | Meaning                             | Purpose in PXE                                  |
		| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
		| DHCP      | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol | Assigns IP, provides boot file name & TFTP info |
		| TFTP      | Trivial File Transfer Protocol      | Transfers boot files to client                  |
		| dnsmasq   | Lightweight server                  | Combines DHCP + TFTP (and DNS if needed)        |

    syslinux-common & pxelinux – BIOS PXE bootloaders
	{
		syslinux-common
		What it is:
			syslinux-common is part of the SYSLINUX project — a suite of lightweight bootloaders for starting Linux systems.
			This package provides shared files used by different bootloaders in the SYSLINUX family.

		it contains Common files like:
			- ldlinux.c32
			- libcom32.c32
			- menu.c32
			- vesamenu.c32

		These are support files that help with:
			- Menus
			- Graphics
			- Advanced boot options

		Think of syslinux-common as the "toolkit" or "library" used by specific bootloaders like pxelinux.

		pxelinux
		What it is:
			pxelinux is a bootloader for PXE clients, part of the SYSLINUX family.

		Its job:
			It is the actual bootloader binary that a PXE client downloads and runs after contacting the TFTP server.
			It reads the PXE configuration file, usually found in:
				/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
				Or:
				/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default

		What it includes:
			pxelinux.0: the actual PXE bootloader (this is what you set in the DHCP config)
			Works with .c32 files from syslinux-common to show boot menus, load kernel/initrd, etc.

		How They Work Together in PXE Boot:
			1)PXE client gets IP from DHCP (dnsmasq) and is told to download pxelinux.0 from TFTP.
			2)TFTP server (also dnsmasq) serves pxelinux.0 from a directory like /tftpboot/.
			3)pxelinux.0 is the bootloader binary (from pxelinux package).
			4)It then loads:
				- Config file (pxelinux.cfg/default)
				- Menu files (menu.c32, vesamenu.c32, etc. from syslinux-common)
				- Kernel and initrd
			5)Boot begins!

			| Package           | What It Does                                  | Key File(s)                     |
			| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
			| `syslinux-common` | Provides shared support files for bootloaders | `menu.c32`, `ldlinux.c32`, etc. |
			| `pxelinux`        | PXE-specific bootloader                       | `pxelinux.0`                    |

    tftpd-hpa – Optional (but we’ll use dnsmasq's built-in TFTP)

    apache2 – HTTP server (for scalable file delivery later)


We'll use /srv/tftp as our root (standard in Ubuntu for custom services):
sudo mkdir -p /srv/tftp/pxelinux.cfg
sudo mkdir -p /srv/tftp/EFI/BOOT
sudo mkdir -p /srv/http
